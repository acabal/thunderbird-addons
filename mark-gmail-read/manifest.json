If your GMail uses localized (translated) Gmail folder names, you have to set three Thunderbird preferences: extensions.mark_gmail_read.folder_names.(all_mail|important|starred). If these names do not correspond to the actually shown folder names under the [GMail] folder, you can expect unwanted behavior, e.g. marking all messages in all folders as read.",
